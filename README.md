# Shift Checkbox

## Description

This is the tenth exercise in the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 challenge. The challenge was to create a function that would check multiple boxes when holding shift and clicking the inputs.

- My motivation was to continue to build my skillset
- This exercise was more complicated than it initially appeared.
- I got about halfway through solving it before referring back to the challenge video. I intend to rebuild this in the future from memory as further practice.

## Usage

The user is presented with a checklist that directs them on what to do. I have included a screenshot that verifies the functionality through console logs.
